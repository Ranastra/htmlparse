# htmlparse
Ever wanted to write unreadable procedural/object-oriented python code to generate HTML and CSS? there you go!
Feel free to do whatever you want with this!

test.py produces some actual working ugly-looking HTML stuff with the procedural api :)
html_method_chaining.py has the same with method chaining (obviously), most of the methods return either self, the created child tag or the parent tag.
